# memu Chip 8

# Notes

- The operation names in the log output and debug views are based on the [cowgod reference](devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).
  Occasionally, I added an extra character to the name to make different variants of the same instruction more distinct.

# Resources

I modelled the chip-8 instruction set based on the following resources:
